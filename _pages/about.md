As an ambitious individual with a passion for learning and innovations, working with people on impactful projects drives me. In doing so, I am currently focusing on projects, mainly in the area of Microsoft PowerApps (Power BI, Power Query, Power Virtual Agents, Power Automate), Website-Creation, and Design Thinking.
