<!--Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.-->

<!--Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
